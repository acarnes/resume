    \textit{Denver, CO}
    \begin{stuff}
        \vspace*{1mm}
                \item Trained a convolutional neural network to identify pneumothorax (collapsed lungs) in chest xrays better than any algorithm in literature and as accurately as human radiologists
                \item Created a machine learning algorithm called OSPRI to flag patients at high risk for pressure injuries (bed sores) better than any pressure injury predictor in literature 
%                \item OSPRI has a ROC AUC of 0.90, a sensitivity of 0.83, and a specificity of 0.80, better than any pressure injury predictor in literature 
                \item Deployed OSPRI in cooperation with the wound care nurses at Swedish hospital to reduce reportable pressure injuries by 75\%
                \item Created a machine learning algorithm (AMISS) to detect present on admission septic shock better than any septic shock predictor in literature
                \item Managed a team of big data engineers to implement AMISS as a real-time streaming application
%                \item AMISS detects septic shock with a ROC AUC of 0.98, 92\% sensitivity and 92\% specificity, and a median time of 40 minutes, better than any septic shock detector in literature
                \item Deployed AMISS in partnership with ED leadership to flag septic patients and alert ED physicians by text message in real-time
                \item AMISS beat ED physicians to the diagnosis 50\% of the time and reduced the mean time to treatment by 100 minutes
                \item Modeled the spread of COVID-19 for continental division hospitals to determine required staff, beds, and ventilators for our division hospitals 
                \item This COVID-19 model predicted the peak to within 25 COVID ICU patients for a 7 hospital system, an error of 25\%
                \item By comparison, note that the widely used Imperial College of London's COVID-19 model was off by a factor of 20x
                \item Worked on a real-time predictive algorithm called HAPI that predicts which patients will likely deteriorate and have an unexpected transfer to the ICU
                \item Implemented HAPI in partnership with clinical data science and the rapid response team to reduce unplanned transfers by 20\% and mortality by 10\% 
                \item Developed an NLP algorithm (SCUBA) to reconcile supply chain spend data against written contracts to find unclaimed rebates
                \item Implemented SCUBA in partnership with supply chain leadership to save over \$1.5 million per year for continental division
                \item Developed COVID NLP to identify over 1000 COVID positive patients in real-time who would have been misplaced in our hospitals
                \item Developed AI computing infrastructure with fast GPUs and solid state storage to facilitate imaging, NLP, and AI on large datasets
                \item Managed and upskilled a team of 8 analysts to use ubuntu and python, learn NLP and machine learning, and automate their reports
                \item The team of analysts were able to use their new infrastructure and skills to improve Hospice use by 35\%, catch an extra 400 MRSA infections per year, recoup over \$4 million per year in missed charges, and win and maintain the award for best large healthcare system according to IBM Watson Health 
               \item Worked with employees and leadership across many facets of HealthONE to develop and implement a variety of successful products with measurable success

    \section{\mysidestyle Testimonials}
              "Andrew really knew what he was talking about and knew exactly how to relay the information. Even as a TA, he is one of the best teachers I have had."
             \\ \\ "Always had huge supply of tricks and creative ways to approach seemingly difficult problems. Entertaining guy"
             \\ \\ "He is EXCELLENT at explaining physics concepts. He's extremely smart and very funny and nice so he is my favourite TA in my science classes in three years at UF. He also listens to and asks us what we want him to change or improve on, so he's very open to suggestion from his students."
             \\ \\ \\ "He brought humor into the class which definitely helps a lot. He explains questions well. He brought up new ways of looking at problems that can apply elsewhere other than just physics"
             \\ \\ "His understanding of the course material and his ability to approach the material as a student helped me succeed in physics. Also, his selfless interest in physics helped. He would exemplify every concept with all types of crazy examples that he would explain very confidently and in a very step-wise manner. He is the smartest and most understanding physics teacher I've had. He taught better than the actual professors."
             \\ \\ "Andrew was by far the best TA I've had in any subject at UF and am very thankful to him for helping me succeed in PHY 2048"
